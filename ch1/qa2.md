#### b. What is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)? What are common IDEs for python?
**Answer:** An **IDE** is a software application that provides a complete set of tools for writing code. It usually includes a text editor (to write code), build automation tools, and a debugger (to find and fix errors).

**Common Python IDEs include:**
* **IDLE:** (Bundled with Python) Great for beginners.
* **VS Code:** A very popular, lightweight, and powerful editor.
* **VS Code forks** VS Code forks are  independent IDEs built on the open-source Visual Studio Code codebase. Some prominent examples are:- (a) Cursor (b) VSCodium (c) Google AntiGravity (d) Code-Server and (e) Windsurf (Codeium)
* **PyCharm:** A professional-grade IDE specifically for Python.

#### c. What is the advantage of using Interactive mode (a.k.a. shell mode)?
**Answer:** Interactive mode is very handy for running a single line of code or a small block of code to see immediate results. It is excellent for testing new ideas, checking how a function works, or doing quick calculations without needing to save a file.

#### d. What does the ‘>>>’ on python shell indicate?
**Answer:** The **`>>>`** is called the **Python Prompt**. It indicates that the Python interpreter is ready and waiting for you to type a command. Once you press Enter, Python will execute that command immediately.

#### e. What is script mode (a.k.a. program mode)?
**Answer:** Script mode is used when you want to write a complete program. Unlike interactive mode, you type your code into a text file (saved with a `.py` extension). This allows you to save your work, run all the code at once, and share your program with others to run on their computers.

#### f. What does the comma do when placed between items to be printed?
**Answer:** When you use a comma inside a `print()` function, it does two things:
1.  It allows you to print multiple different items (like a string and a number) at the same time.
2.  It automatically adds a **single space** between each item.

**Example:** `print("Age:", 15)` will output `Age: 15`.

#### g. What are triple quoted strings in python? What are their advantage(s)?
**Answer:** Triple quoted strings are strings enclosed in three single quotes (`'''`) or three double quotes (`"""`).

**Key Advantages:**
* **Multi-line Strings:** They allow a string to span across several lines without needing special characters.
* **No Escaping:** You can include regular single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`) inside them without breaking the code.
* **Docstrings:** They are the standard way to write documentation for functions and classes.

##### a. What are some other good naming conventions in python?

·       Avoid using names that are too general or too wordy. Strike a good balance between the two.

·       Bad: data\_structure, my\_list, info\_map, dictionary\_for\_the\_purpose\_of\_storing\_data\_representing\_word\_definitions

·       Good: user\_profile, menu\_options, word\_definitions

·       Don’t use names like “O”, “l”, or “i”

·       When using CamelCase names, capitalize all letters of an abbreviation (e.g. HTTPServer because HTTP is an abbreviation.)
